I’m sending this message from Sai Kung beach in Hong Kong. It’s very relaxing and fun and I hope that everyone is able to destress a little bit given what’s happened recently. I also hope my people there are having some chill time given everything that’s happening now.

Stay strong and hope world will end up a changed but better place at the end of the pandemic.
