# Please record a 10-60 second message
to the LGBTQ community around the world to give them a virtual hug whenever they feel they need it.

Any language is okay.

If you can, writing your main sentence or idea out would help people know what message you have. In any language is fine!

Below is a sample of how a voice message is. 

You can submit anonymously!
