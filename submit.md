## Share your Message

As well as being a place for listening, we want this website to give LGBTQ people the opportunity to share their Pride messages and express their thoughts to others. 

All voice messages are welcome - share whatever youâ€™d like to say/shout/sing! 

Your message can be any length, in any language, and as political, personal or joyful as you like. You can submit anonymously, or include a few more details.

Allies who wish to express messages of support for LGBTQ people are also welcome.
