![](https://i.imgur.com/6gd0j5V.png)

**What is the Pride Polyphony?**
The Pride Polyphony is a collection of audio messages expressing support and solidarity, from and to the LGBTQ community worldwide. 

**How did the project start?**
The project grew out of the Digital Pride Hackathon in May 2020, created by (full names?). As 2020 saw widespread lockdowns and the cancellation of Pride celebrations in many cities, we wanted to create an online space where the voices that didn’t get to speak/sing/shout this Pride season could be heard. 

**Who is the Pride Polyphony for?**
The Pride Polyphony is for all LGBTQQIP2SAA people and allies who would like to listen to messages of solidarity and share messages of support, or tell others about their experiences.

**Can I submit a voice message?**
Yes! We’d love to hear your audio messages. Everyone LGBTQ is welcome to submit, and we’re also open to messages of support from allies.

The form for submissions is here: [https://form.jotform.com/201356271318046](https://form.jotform.com/201356271318046). If you have any questions, email us at [pride.polyphony@gmail.com](mailto:pride.polyphony@gmail.com).

**Who created the Pride Polyphony? **
We started as a group of three LGBTQ people who came up with the idea and brought it to life as part of the Digital Pride Hackathon: (names and info).
